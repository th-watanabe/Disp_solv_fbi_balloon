This code is created for analysis of the feedback and ballooning instabilities in the magnetosphere and ionosphere coupling system.
The results are used for the paper, "Feedback and ballooning instabilities in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling" by T.-H. Watanabe, submitted to Geophysical Research Letters.
